# Tailwind CSS Class Application Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applying correctly to elements in a React application.  The issue is intermittent and seems to be related to class order or potential conflicts.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm start`.
4. Observe the unexpected styling on the affected elements in the browser. 

## Potential Causes and Solutions

The root cause is currently under investigation.  Potential causes include:

* Incorrect class ordering.
* Conflicting class names or utility definitions.
* Issues with the Tailwind CSS configuration or setup.
* Problems with the build process or transpilation.

The solution involves identifying the exact conflict or error and addressing it accordingly.  This might involve adjustments to the Tailwind config, refactoring CSS classes, or investigating build process issues.
